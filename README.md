[This is my website](https://sravana9.github.io/e42-website/)
## Steps to follow to create a website and cofigure to github 
- **git config --global user.name "Your name"**  
- **git config -- global user.email "Your email address"**
- open Git Bash
- change directory to the folder you created enahnce42
- create a directory e42-website using mkdir
- change directory to e42-website
- do git init
- check with git status
- create file README.md with touch command 
 Once the configuration is done, _go to terminal_, in the dropdown change the option from powershell to **bash** and close it
 Again open the terminal, u could observe **bash**.
**Commands used in the terminal**
 - git status
 - git add README.md (if there are any changes made to the file)
 - git commit -m "general text" (so that changes could be noticed with the message") 
 - git log
 - git push   
**Go to [github](github.com/new)**
 - _create_ a repository with any name.
 - Then go to _settings_, in that move on to _github pages_, then change the option from none to **main** and **save**.
 - Again come back to the _github pages_, there you could observe a [**link**]((https://sravana9.github.io/e42-website/)) that has been published.
